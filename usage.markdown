# Usage

## General


### Toolbar
The plugin adds a new toolbar with two Buttons

**D** = Draw Tool and **L** = Layer Tool

In case the toolbar is hidden enable it in the _Toolbar_ Menu:

### Survey size warning

In case the survey area is larger than 1000.00 km2, a warning is shown as this might result in a very large API request.

### Information about found data

Take note of the status messages at the top of the map window. A green success message informs about a successful search.
A orange warning means no data has been returned from a API.

### Attribute table

The created layer is filled with the returned data. This is generalized for both APIs.
The source column shows the API source. Tags are special for OSM and will only be filled in OSM API requests.
In case no data is retuned for a column a "-" is used.
